          This is the interface of the ReVSeq project that aims at providing an overview on the genetic
          diversity of respiratory viruses in Switzerland as well as fostering an understanding of their
          evolution. Samples from patients with general respiratory virus symptoms are collected at Viollier
          AG (as part of the routine diagnostics).

          First, all traces of human DNA sequence are removed from the samples. Second, the obtained sequence
          data is matched to reference sequences of known respiratory viruses, such as influenza or RSV.
          Third, virus consensus sequences are generated, and finally the type of virus causing the infection
          in each sample is identified. Virus sequence data and consensus sequences are shared with the
          public, by uploading data to
